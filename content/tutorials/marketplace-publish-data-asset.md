## What can be published?

Ocean Market provides a convenient interface for individuals as well as organizations to publish their data. Data set can be images, location information, audio, video, sales data, or combinations of all! There is no exhaustive list of what type of data can be published on the Market. Please note that the Ocean Protocol team maintains a purgatory list [here](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/list-purgatory) to block addresses and remove assets for any violations.

## Tutorial

### Connecting wallet and navigating to publish page

1. Go to <a href="https://v4.market.oceanprotocol.com " target="_blank">Ocean Market</a>

### Step 3 - Set pricing

Before the asset is published, the user(s) can choose the pricing option as per their choice. Only the publisher can set the pricing option and cannot be changed once the publisher selects any one method.

There are 3 options for settings the price of an asset on Ocean Marketplace.

1. Fixed pricing
2. Dynamic pricing (using Balancer pools)
3. Free pricing

Here, we are selecting dynamic pricing.
