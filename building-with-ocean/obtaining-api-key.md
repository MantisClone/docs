# Obtaining API key for Ethereum node provider

Ocean Protocol's smart contracts are deployed on EVM-compatible networks. Using an API key provided by a third-party Ethereum node provider allows you to interact with the Ocean Protocol's smart contract on the supported networks without requiring you to host your local node.

Choose any API provider of your choice. Some of the commonly used are:

* [Infura](https://infura.io/)
* [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/)
* [Moralis](https://moralis.io/)

Please refer [this page](./../core-concepts/networks.md) for more information on supported networks.
